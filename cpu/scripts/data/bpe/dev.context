i 'm trying to bait my crush into asking me , and nothing .

we should probably keep this a secret .
now i know why .
bro , i spent two hours at the chair place .
actually , you don 't have to worry about ordering .
yeah .
let 's go .
i didn 't want to be trapped in that life .

the baby is healthy , your panels are normal , but your blood pressure is a little bit higher than i 'd like .

yeah , i was thinking about just wiping it down , pocke@@ ting the 100 bucks .
behind walls is where you belong .
what ?
got through olympus 's firewall .
or not so accidental .
yeah , but i found the hairs inside the jacket , so maybe somebody else was wearing her jacket ?
actually , i have a little bit of an idea .
copy that , officers ?
and this mysterious buyer ...
no one will be sold .
and then , let 's show our guests a good time .
alex , the chosen one , has disappeared .
your make - believe kingdom is a real soap opera .
they get smarter people to do the research , and then they steal it themselves .
get down on your knees .
because life is too short .
great talk , papa .
he 'll be laying low till the coast 's clear .
they 've got some sort of high - frequency disruption field .
maybe it 's personal .
he grabs their faces .
whose life do you want to destroy to stay free ?
and you thought wearing a ski mask was a good ice breaker ?
why would he sign ?
- all the other boys were whistling , sir .
you weren 't with our mother .
davis was conscious and talking about the battle .
i 'm really sorry , mom .
so , you 're saying that women should get paid in fried chicken now ?
but i always came up with an excuse not to come .
a clockwork prince .
rick did it .
yes , thank you .
let 's - let 's wait and - and see if we can find out who he is .
now , lukas , you 're not going anywhere until you tell me what the hell 's going on .
you 're lucky it 's not broken .
he and five others were assassinated , probably by eva a@@ za@@ ro@@ va , your agent .
fli@@ b@@ bit isn 't hiring co@@ ders .
we 're here to help .
these views .
if you harm him , they 'll disappear forever .
they chose you to protect them .
i don 't need anyone .
the best thing you can do for sha@@ y@@ la - - allow her to become a memory .
i didn 't think it would go like this , this fast .
it is a limit of nature .
i can 't run , tyler .
leading the guard for all those years .
no , there 's been a mail hold on that address .
how could i not be excited about that ?
that sounds like a complete waste of time .
that 's because there is no " one true love . "
cla@@ mping the splen@@ ic hi@@ lum .
and what they do with it ... only time will tell .
" rose gallagher " has a - - a ring to it , don 't you think ?
- he 's not missing .
i wanted france and england to fall at your feet .
he won 't even know you slipped through his fingers .
adams house grill .
she wasn 't born in england ?
do you mind if i ask you some questions about harry cole ?
i - i know i shouldn 't have , but she sounded scared .
i 'm heading over to kathryn 's town@@ house .
yeah , no , plant hates him .
i will not raise taxes on working families .
that 's not what i 'm suggesting , but , hell , why not ?
i was so busy looking for something high - tech , that i almost missed the low - tech .
i 'm certain i want to try .
i 'm stalling c@@ cs as it is .
( chuckles )
i mean , do you know how much money she 's worth ?
gentlemen , everyone !
we had this big row .
you say fun ...
because if i didn 't , he would 've killed my mom .
you ain 't the man i need to talk to .
all right , so , what do we do now ?
sorry .
hound .
i know that i 'm really opini@@ on@@ ated , and so are you .
years ago .
we roll out the platinum carpet , darling .

it was to save james from you because you 're out of control .
elizabeth .

they 're not the dearly departed .
oh , yeah , yeah , the lipstick cameras .
mr co@@ ates needs me .
yes , i suppose i am .
i know the best one .

you have no life .
and he 's definitely trying to kill his ex - wife .
valerie !
what are you expecting to find ?
don 't be .
he coded upstairs ten minutes ago .
i think regina mentioned that .
barbara ku@@ chen@@ ski go@@ li@@ she@@ v@@ sky !
she wouldn 't have wanted us sobbing over her grave , wallowing in self - pity .
look , there is nothing in the patrol guide about this .
i 'm supposed to help you guys now ?
" glea@@ mingly " ?
give it a read .
um , yeah , not just ... not just yet .
okay , i 'm in .
no , i 'm good .
well , then fucking do it .
you know , some kind of fitting memorial .
at least there , she had doctors .
na@@ z said there was a position opening up at the c@@ j@@ c and it 's mine if i want it .
the people must know we stand together on this , that it was not done without purpose .
move past what ?
friend of the family owns the place .
you don 't forget a guy who throws up in the back of your patrol car .
it is no cough .
he just showed up .
i 'm a tenu@@ red professor , a german citizen .
i know .
lucy , listen to me .
- poly@@ technique , in paris .
history tells me that one - third of you will fail .
so , i improvise .
no one 's gonna be crying over how we catch these terrorists .
oh , shit !
real rich deals .
being at the mercy of larger forces is not my happy place .
elevated levels of colony collapse disorder along the northeast .
okay , santa 's po@@ oping .
a demonstration for the japanese high command .

this one 's looking good !
in about a year , you 're gonna get a postcard from a wad@@ sworth din@@ sdale .
- do you know what happened ?
did you not think we 'd check ?
flan@@ ag@@ an was telling the truth .
it 's the combination of factors .
i 'd like to do a ct scan of your abdomen .
i don 't know yet .
you want to come with me , we can escape together .
sure .
♪ oh , baby ♪
but reading this , this is not my words .
bad deal for her .
i overloaded the serum .
i guess he helps it along .
how much more .
no , but , ugh , i 'm telling you , the motive has something to do with whatever happened in the kappa bathroom 20 years ago .
someone beat us to it .
but we need a decision .
what , darling ?
people pass it down unsolved for generations .
but it 's too large for a kidney or gall@@ stone and too regular for a fibro@@ id .
it 's like hunting , but you don 't have to pretend you like deer meat .
something 's wrong .
you just shut your eyes again , yeah ?
now all the boys are hounding me and i can 't stay here .
i am not waiting in the car !
kyle was your son .
linda , i 'll drive you to the motel .
unless i bring in a big - fish client , yup .
so that 's it , then .
then why am i here ?
how many months are we talking , doctor , until this transplant could happen ?
as long as it takes for me to get what i want .
- what would you like me to do ?
- sour cream .
not many .
that 's when i overheard the fight he had with his ex - boyfriend .
no !
together .
you 've sold your soul !
bailey 's gonna hit you up to expense a dna test .
you have the right to an attorney .
but in 90 seconds , he will be dead , dead !
shut up .
demons slaughtered my family .
yeah , i got his last three .
and , who goes through all of this trouble to end their life , and not leave a suicide note ?
yes , the americans came .
take the jersey .
still have a few more days of chemo and radiation .
you talk to your wife like that ?
she did not need a man to complete her .
i do understand what you 're going through .
- we 're at security .
why would i give life advice to the big kid who 's fucking me ?
you have that right now .
i have no idea .
if he finds out that he might have a son that grew up without even knowing him , it would crush him .
i understand why you 'd think that .
1-@@ 1-@@ 3-@@ 1 .
i don 't ...
all right , i 'll talk to you later .
i tried my best not to act on anything .
he would like to offer you an ambassa@@ dor@@ ship to the international civil aviation organization .
now that is so not okay , my friend .
self - imposed .
alec , i 'm impressed .
now i am done talking about this .
just awful .
how the hell did you manage this ?
a grand arena , ten years in the making .
none of your business .
make the world a better place .
if tito sent this guy to get the kid , he 's not gonna fire that thing in here .
please find my daughter .
j@@ aden ?
yes , he is .
she 's trying to be brave but i can see something running around inside her , behind her eyes .
i bet you thought it was fate .
got him .
and i gave charles the best life that i could , mary .
we 're three hours late .
stay back .
i 've read all your files , charlie .
you could have just called .
read a book .
the manufactured one .
but when magic came back ...
do you mind going in the bathroom and seeing if there 's an old lady in there ?
it 's a classic .
it is why i brought you here .
i 'm leaving .
when did you learn to read russian ?
bitch can never be proud of me either .
if you 're weak , you 'll be slow .
they want to scare you into saying something that 's not covered .
my mom showed up out of nowhere .
listen man , i was there in the 90s .
carl nash , ex - homicide , van nu@@ ys .
her request to work perimeter detail at the d@@ nc in new york , giving her access to grand central .
it 's ... complicated .
i don 't know what to say .
so , uh ...
uh , first of all , i 'd steer clear of " bouquet . "
tara 's mom said right out of school she bagged groceries .
what ?
too much bach .
you guys will not believe what we found out on that
saved his life .
max , you 've upset a very powerful being .
i know what i need to do .
after school .
this seems to be the way gro@@ sser , less whim@@ si@@ cal version of that .
no , you came after me first .
- i 'm on it , boss .
he 's gonna be testifying against different zy@@ k@@ lons for at least the next couple years .
how would it look ?
we only used the blood sample to test for rabies .
why don 't you start with who they are .
it 's only been a few weeks , you know , so i 'm not concerned about it .
well , perhaps , before i write to delaney , we should speak about india .
that 's shit .
that 's what i 'm gonna tell the jury .
and living in white plains .
if the reserve fails , we lose him .
that 's a big step .
i 'll sleep here .
what time did spence leave the party ?
sir , before you do anything to him , do you mind if i get a big tip ?
hell , look at china .
it could have been far worse .
why didn 't you say anything ?
just take a later train .
everyone has their own fucked - up@@ ness .
are you two close ?
does she know ?
it 's happening already .
this is my daughter we 're talking about , robert .
be careful in the world of men , diana .
theo 's birth wasn 't registered for days .
okay , it 's not amelia 's room anymore .
what do you women even do in there ?
i have family money .
now prove your loyalty .
i don 't want to leave anything that can trace back to us .
it 's a place that i used to go camping with my dad .
we kill .
♪ in silence
- this guy , right ?
where mer 's concerned , just , you know , give as good as you get .
nobody signed anything .
whereas this poor chap , well , he 's not going anywhere , is he ?
to be honest , she was quite upset at seeing marigold again .
there 's two ?
all right , let 's back it up .
through her company .
we 're hoping you can move us along .
always ... an argument .
i just wanted to watch the movie and get out of there before it got awkward .
i love you .
am i a warm weather guy or a cold weather guy ?
at least not for your company .
maybe you heard of him .
what sample ?
back shield , ease up on my throat !
they 're already here .
yeah , i guess we did .
look , claire , you 're not the only one to lose , okay ?
this is not my job anymore .
i must say , he 's quite a@@ gile for a man his size .
don 't .
what about yvonne ?
oh , of course we 're proud of you , kevin .
she 's somewhere out there in a cart .
i 'm back on food .
adam hunt , ted gay@@ nor , palmer co@@ kes , s@@ achi bee@@ ch .
with defiance ?
what do you want me to say , people ?
we both spent time overseas .
i 'm serious .
who is that ?
how he looked when he died .
baxter v. california , 1997 , ma@@ der@@ a county .
we know all about your relationship with him , the message you sent him from the witness stand , and the real reason you showed up at the church .
i 'm talking about taking her out of the debate .
but he did say we should bring on more people for the next few hours .
yeah , i could tell .
you did .
mr. jones , hi , this is betty cooper .
you will not be welcomed back here again .
that 's right .
i think she 's gonna marry me and move to manhattan with me .
he seems to have no problem hurting you now .
maybe exactly what you did .
we 're telling people i was there !
it 's my job .
- yeah .
we cannot go back .
it 's a match for russell tillman .
what 's his story ?
and my leg , is that a delusion ?
agreed .
raul .
fuck .
a report c@@ ites a 13 % chance of go@@ j@@ ira landing on the west coast .
( sighs ) ( indistinct chatter )
ok .
i saw you , mom .
he picked a place where he could install his malicious script on multiple victims ' phones , all at the same time .
neither will you , without any money .
- scottie , this is unlike you .
is he being threatened ?
to be honest , just , hearing your voice helps .
so perhaps someone found one , took advantage .
you 're werewolves .
you know i could lock you up ?
no .
leaving him free run of the ship is not an option .
i was sad you invited gemma .
talking about the church thing .
he 's at the 8@@ 2nd precinct in brooklyn right now being questioned .
that matches lle@@ well@@ yn 's height .
am i interrupting some creepy foreplay you two have ?
i put together some info for you .
oh , they 're quite ready .
i hated that man for doing what he did to me , so i did what messed up 15 - year - olds do .
i was wrong .
i just feel sea@@ sick .
you go after ryan hardy , and you fail , you put a target right on your back .
julian is just as upset as any of us .
but you are my home .
no .
well , if this guy was looking for the treasure , wouldn 't there be some old ropes ?
meaning ?
no , sabrina , i was in a rush ...
thank you , doctor .
no , of course not .
so please just tell me straight :
listen !
there we have it .
that 's useless .
christop@@ he .
yes , i lately met one of the candidates .
i 'm not fighting so some man or woman i barely know can sit in a throne made of swords .
it 's not the first time , recently .
better than me .
this isn 't some message from a serial killer , it 's our jane doe 's roller derby number .
yeah , i mean , who remembers the number of orgasms they 've had in their life ?
so every meeting ended with a plan for the next one .
i 'm not technically here .
it wasn 't like her to just not show up .
no .
how have you been sleeping at night ?
you 'll forgive me if i 'm feeling a little overprotective .
i 'll bet he 's comin ' for me next , so i 'll see the three of you on the other side .
she grew up .
- you 'll really love it .
okay .
when i got news , i 'll call you .
how is she ?
like simon .
very true .
jess , why do you have to scare your sister like that ?
my hands are clean .
only so long meat loaf can hold on to prime rib , right ?
i - i know how tough things have been for you and booth .
you were never gonna propose , todd .
nothing really worked .
it 's all coming back to me now .
hold it steady .
it took some time to verify your alibi .
this is a matter for the police now .
he would have seen all the intel mi6 was developing .
that 's what i got for you .
you 're a part of doing it right now .
it 's not like that .
what would you do ?
madam president - elect .
i know what i said before , but a son needs his father , and i need him .
sugar , time to get grandpa the fuck out of here .
check any properties they own .
she 's definitely going to propose .
your suffering is almost over .
ma ' am , hello .
who saw that coming ?
isn 't that enough for you ?
he thinks it makes you more like us , but ... you 're nothing like us .
i didn 't know how to start .
she 's getting a cup of coffee .
do you have any idea what that was ?
and that 's how you 've been trying to fix this .
now is that what i think it is , little lady ?
gi@@ do .
at the police station .
what do you got ?
it 's got me all paranoid .
wow , look at that .
what do you do ?
helena , too , soon .
you know that thing that people say ,
john , sometimes i feel i need you to be more in the moment .
you are going to be just fine .
i 'm going for the gun .
precisely .
that 's the miracle the world 's been waiting for .
small or large , really ?
i love my brother .
you can take that seat right over there .
sve@@ t@@ lana , my friend ker@@ mit over here is gonna sing " stroke me . "
obviously .
if we can trust ward , we can trust this is a risk worth taking .
what if it 's a trap ?
this is the smo@@ kers ' lounge .
you wanted the baby to see the eclipse ?
" one of many . "
- good to go .
look , this is really silly .
freedom .
i am , yeah .
no , no .
the press will get their news from us .
will you please just stop talking to me like i 'm insane ?
bad spot .
waiting for the bentley dealer to get back to us with that .
guns , ammo , medical supplies .
nothing like babies for making people smile .
they don 't plan to bring her in operational .
and if i don 't help you ?
well , she got arrested .
thank you for keeping it expe@@ dient .
and that 's the real reason why you left k ' un - lu@@ n , isn 't it ?
what about you , david ?
what exactly did you expect ?
this is exactly what the republicans want .
- sid , we want to get the kids in this ?
why would she switch her phone off if she 's looking to hook up with you ?
now , let 's look at the head wounds again .
that 's ridiculous .
this will .
and now i know the fucker blind ' cause i got some fine - ass legs right here .
someone laundered this money .
what she 's really year@@ ning for is the touch of a gent@@ ler man .
don 't you remember ?
i know , and i 'm working on an antidote .
" what now , god ?
isn 't his office secured by ...
we serve america .
miranda has to accept that i can work and be in an o. r. and learn at the same time .
just stay there .
someone hit him with a blunt object .
the regulator worked , but my translator did not .
enemies to the east .
- oh , man , if she has the code , it is locked down tighter than a nun 's pussy .
don 't worry .
love , chad ra@@ dwell .
- maybe , or maybe she slipped up and actually told the truth .
th - that 's great .
i deal with those every day .
good , because i don 't want him to lose anything else .
the baby was asleep and i didn 't have time to do all the checks .
should i sleep with her ?
bailey spoke to you ?
emma , you 're coming home , right now .
this is detective gibbs .
but hey , you know what ?
it 's me .
how long ?
lemon grass , coconut oil , and jo@@ jo@@ ba .
i 'll make sure and spread the word .
she knows the guys that went missing .
i 'll need to access it .
there were 84 murders in this city last year .
physical pain is better than emotional any day , but believe it or not , talking helps .
someone else trying to frame newton ?
god save the queen .
that doesn 't undo everything else .
i 'm a busy man .
detective .
kind of makes me sick to think you and brandon in the cabin , when i was asleep .
i mean , i don 't have the heart to tell him it was probably for the best .
dr. riggs ?
just , uh , who are you , and where 's lucy ?
okay .
follow me .
what a bo@@ or !
and cody got caught up in whatever game the two of them are playing .
but what if you get lost , or stuck , or something ?
told you .
have you seen the photo they 're using of him ?
you know i do understand .
yeah , isn 't that the point ?
we must keep to our agreed plan .
i don 't know for how long .
to live outside ?
word is , four coyotes inside , two at the door , two in the cash room around back .
ned stark 's blood runs through his veins .
i waited in the car .
[ whispering ] i think i 'm gonna take the deal .
get that way sometimes .
merely to help you be you .
of her singing ?
i thought you were serious about family law .
fucking is how i was taught love .
" et , phone home . "
all right , we 're here .
you ask for time with your family , space for the children , and prayers for the king , blah blah blah .
i don 't want people to see me as a victim .
again .
- so that 's it .
what would i have done ?
- social services is mu@@ lling it over .
if he wants to show her a pollu@@ ted lake , there 's some a lot closer to manhattan .
and i hate you .
and we can work this out .
wait .
this young lady put up quite a fight .
i guess you 're forgetting who replaced the shattered windshield once you peeled dun@@ hill off of it .
no hurting anyone .
i 'm sorry i 'm not her .
is this what your cult believes ?
maybe next time you 'll trust me enough to tell me the full plan .
you were mis@@ directed .
so , you 're saying it could be the same painting .
ali , those painkillers are really strong .
stewie , i would think tom cruise has better things to do than follow you around .
asking if you remember one in particular .
so she sent you to find out ?
uh , we canvassed , talked to a few people who heard shots , looked out their windows .
no .
the dru@@ ids '@@ sleep .
where the hell have you been ?
marty .
your name is john .
oh , man .
all due respect , how did you know he was drunk if nobody examined him ?
so , what 's the plan ?
roll call time .
i think i 'll ride to tren@@ with .
i care about caitlin , but i don 't want to leave wally .
and eventually they 're gonna hang you with it .
and how are we on snack storage ?
we heard everything .
do you think nina is prettier ?
they fought all the time .
we continue to work in parallel with you .
hello !
we need all your files on the gro@@ te case .
so there 's no way i can keep my son safe ?
because it 's a possibility , noah .
mr. mill@@ stone is one of my law students i 've been supervising .
this is how a skull breaks .
and a verdict of not guilty on the murder count will be entered .
hey , look who 's here .
well , i can assure you that 's not the case .
what , you think you can use her , control her ?
- what are you doing ?
who killed her ?
she seems to spend more time with her lap@@ dog than her own mother .
you know when we 're lying .
the other one 's an ex - spy from chad .
he 's gonna be fine .
it might help you ... to tell someone .
we did not copy .
it 's 5.@@ 8 , but please continue .
rough at home , huh ?
right .
we 're the same in that , at least .
i can smell ...
she 's drinking again .
since the blood types of the victims are va@@ ried , have her only look at the universal recipient , ab - positive .
i think that 's just about enough .
that 's me a great - grandma now .
he looks a lot like you .
i have to go .
i am serious .
i mean , before three months ago , any time i called your house or came over or sky@@ ped or whatever ,
as for now , we have to ...
so ... ?
who 's getting the samples ?
edmund ?
i made a bad decision .
i usually open my sets with it .
yes , absolutely .
you 're not going anywhere .
are you serious ?
i 'm not uptight .
i spent 25 years being told what to do .
i 'm dying tomorrow .
is this you outside of work ?
i 'm such a jerk .
i 've heard sherlock rail against the stuff .
i 'd like to buy it .
secondhand exposure .
that 's because you 're right , i am .
let 's throw you out .
nothing like it on earth , certainly not in formula .
why 's that ?
yes , there are no copies .
hey , pop , who died ?
someone must 've found out .
i had no idea that i was picking up simon and will .
what about gsr tests ?
can i get a little support here ?
- yeah .
- i am , m ' lady , but it 's the holidays and i 'm here till the day of the wedding .
when he left , i missed him .
i thought you were going to knock people over , trying to get off that gang@@ way .
some .
he said , " please forgive me . "
it 's gotta bring up things .
and even picked up the art of stealing as well .
i can try .
see who they 're talking to , what their angle is ?
not yet , these women aren 't tal@@ ky , they 're hand@@ sy .
yeah , well , that seems to be the case , but this deal was due to earn the bank a fortune .
steve ...
good , everybody take a seat .
which gets to my next question .
black and white .
i have a full schedule today , quentin .
it 'll be easier for you to get another job if you resign .
because indonesia has the death penalty .
uh , you know .
honestly , i can 't believe what i 'm seeing .
[ chuckles ] how long has he been out now ?
what 's that ?
you were such good friends .
you tried to kill him and ruin us to save your own political ass .
all i did was party a little too hard .
we were hippies and very happy about that .
okay , everything 's gonna be okay .
he doesn 't like to fly .
it was the stuff dru@@ mps are made of .
mr. riggs ...
then let 's go and meet will .
i saw you at the piano .
correct .
sex with who ?
i 'll have the money for him very soon .
mom , she ... told me what happened or what almost happened , apparently .
you are well - informed .
all i 'll say , they were right .
he 's not really van@@ tia , but he was a wise - a man .
we should be fine to land .
that 's why i was getting on that jit@@ ney .
i was in my room where i told you to meet me .
unfortunately , philip now knows he 's a suspect .
i meant to weigh in on the relative merits of three equally defi@@ cient refin@@ ement techniques .
i 've been up half the night surfing chat rooms , trying to see if anyone knows anything .
yeah , let 's do just that .
- what if it takes you longer ?
though not accidentally .
and i 'm trying to trust zelena .
was that unusual ?
yeah , thick as thieves , i reckon .
winn !
i have to go .
re@@ ena ...
innocent until proven guilty .
hey , i 've been thinking about what you said .
what ... park ?
you knew me when i had hair , mr. president .
i 'm not the one who let her die .
um , maybe .
- me and their manager .
where are they ?
yeah , and super@@ human beasts , too .
ask me after i find a place to sleep tonight .
my finger slipped , i panicked .
bad boy .
i know .
i got to keep cra@@ mming for this test .
you 're out of ammo .
( phone ringing )
looks like a covert cabal operation , an execution gone wrong .
what are you talking about ?
my mistake .
two of them had connections to rock@@ well .
neal , what 's up , man ?
a way out .
what makes these special ?
i 'm not sure .
i didn 't know you were into girls .
i would like to ask you something completely off the record ,
because i 'm trying to tell you something , and i really want you to hear me .
i believed he could get better .
you should know that .
alec , i 'll talk to carlos .
what 's going on in here ?
look , i know you blame me for coming to iran in the first place .
i told you it wasn 't a game , ms. grant .
