or perhaps he 's betrayed you .
the way to k ' un - lu@@ n was open .
yes , he 's my father .

that 's enough .
she didn 't even wait to say hi to marcus .

her work ?

you 're also the most successful .

a priceless gift .
if they see that fri@@ gate parked there , it 's a bad day for me too .

this has provided the unsub with a victim pool who have dropped their guard .
little secret , wade .
the photos and videos on social media ...

you 're still a sworn officer of the court .

there 's a lot of eyes on you .
your shoulder ...

juli@@ san me@@ lun@@ awe@@ h wa@@ sha@@ set .
there was an incident last night outside one of the checkpoints into salem .
agents elliott and savage .
you were right about the plant matter .
his work has been getting a lot of buzz .
so you two must help each other out a lot ... two single parents .
that 's what i 'm paying you for .
oh , yeah .
well , you 've been right so far .
i 'm not coming with you .
i will do this .
sometimes she liked that .
okay , looks like the thieves were in and out in under two minutes .
since when do new york bankers have patch intel we don 't ?

all right , charles , i know that you 're freaking out and you think you 're never gonna be a father , but don 't worry ;
i am so sorry , liz .
she 's picky about talking to strangers .
but after all this time and waiting , we probably won 't even get to use him .
i 've done a bunch of research and i jo@@ tted down some ideas for your cuba speech .
i 'm about to present you with an opportunity .
well , based on his speech this morning , they 've got their work cut out for them .
i 've been thinking about this for the last 20 years .
- give you a chance to prepare .
the administrative hearing last year , you had to make your case to stay on with the department .
actually , duck , i 'm in , uh , virtual philly here trying to dig up a few more smuggling suspects .
♪ and i want you
but you already have .
my ... first time .
well , i don 't think she was .
stop worrying about disappointing mom .
exactly , but the genie would be forced to wander the earth until a new master rubs the lamp .
and how am i supposed to do that ?
yeah , i 'm not wearing any makeup .
i was here all night .
- what 's wrong with your ass ?
then don 't , motherfucker .
elizabeth , unlike a lot of other people you 're curious .
oh , my god , she 's a grimm !
what is it ?
that 's how you sell .
a special case .
and not too vacant .
oh , sorry , it 's just ... thought i recognized your order too .
except he 's not .
that is a very dark street to walk every night .
but the memory still exists somewhere .
he 's got four fucking kids and , like , a thousand ex - girlfriends .
i want you to confess to the one thing that you 've been afraid to admit to yourself .
and if my mother only knew what you were like , she would not listen to you either .
you 're right .
right , so carlo calls his morally - challenged ex - girlfriend .
okay , vampires , aliens , even werewolves , i get it .
cast the parasite to hell , and i 'll free the girl .
what is that powder ?
you - you lock my people up , you attack them ?
this is not my job anymore .
yeah , you must 've read the old testament part .
uh , no .
well , the gift karl gave to me was far more valuable .
no , don 't put her on , i 've only got a couple of minutes .
imagine a fleet of qu@@ inje@@ ts launching from here .
not that i was a nerd or anything .
all right , just give me the fucking waiver .
tell us , b , and we 'll do it .
a broad@@ sword was found in the bed that they shared .
go get him .
you don 't want her in that position , and neither do i.
i 've got a second team there .
it 's a simple thing , a little dinner , chit - chat , dancing .
bryce , could you excuse us ?
every single day .
we are gonna pay for your ticket back .
when he confessed to you ?
all right , everyone , please , do not panic .

i came to support anna@@ lise .
just the flash .
i spent 20 years waiting for death , " al " .
but ... fine .
i didn 't want her to go , but we felt that it 's safer for me like this .
what if you do what sands wants ?
you haven 't changed .
my parents met through a service .
i 'm sorry .
it 's not like we 're a couple .
honestly , would a prohibition really stop a man from drinking ?
we 've been cell@@ mates for three months , henry .
the real story is , the day before ,
okay , in english or in any other language ,
they sold us for a fix .
" it 's me , rupert murdoch , and the hottest bin laden .
we spend our lives teaching them to be strong , to be independent .
they tortured each other by having affairs with people close to them .
honestly , you 're our hero right now .
like who sold you the drugs ?
you 're not the one who had to wran@@ gle a next - gen surveillance drone from the air force .
then you should find her all the more eager to serve !
but , you know , i mean , it 's like vincent , he 's always had this way of charming my dad .
and you 're still using the present tense .
am i too late ?
we got to put this ring on a col@@ ton .
we can do this back at the station , if you 'd prefer .
two hours ago , we pulled this audio off a secure channel in russia .

listen , if you 're not capable of controlling your class , it 's not our problem ...
is this what you want as well ?
anything could have happened to her .
i 'm fine .
it 's beautiful , honey .
- no , i 'm good , man , thank you .
it 's too late .
before you spiral any more , you should take a pregnancy test .
and we checked your gun .
give me a minute .
my boyfriend .
no .
i can 't help it .
i tried to get to the bottom of it and discovered that jin and min ha were also involved .
did all the other boo@@ ths have pens ?
your rival , back again .
those allegations have never been confirmed .
so how can i help you ?
the fact that the ring isn 't in my house is the reason i slept like a baby last night , okay ?
actually , i think danny should run with it .
and i totally get what you were saying today ...
that is not where my head is at right now .
we thought he just took over - - who 'd he have to fight ?
people are scared .
ah , this is fern , our midwife .
i don 't know anything about your mother ...
put me on with her .
we already covered this .
the kind of people who risk their lives so that we can walk safe at night in our own neighborhoods .
give up control when it 's the one thing that makes you happy ?
yes , i want to apologize , but i 'm not wrong .
unfortunately , no .

i told prince ari@@ on everything .
he wants us to be more .
i know that .

no .
he was wrong .
definitely a body dump .
- oh , my god .
on the other side of that ride , yeah .
- get set !
that 's her leaving her building .
ray stole from me .

i 'll tell you something , if you were in trouble , he 'd be there for you in a fuckin '@@ minute .
something tells me it 's not that simple .
my name is ?
because your client 's last name is reagan ?
then it was artemis ' plot to wreak revenge on her brother .
hey , flo , i could use your help .
please , my father was all that i had !
a ring .
not kin .
all right , i 'm gonna run with the car@@ jack victims .
promise ?
reagan , he 's hiding something .

if he held a gun like this , shot himself , that would explain how gunshot residue got on both sleeves , right ?
nothing plays like pictures in court .

i heard you were an honourable man .
if we die ?
don 't be like me .
that bomb at your house was meant for you .

i have a guard on it 24 / 7 .
i 'm right when they attacked the girl on the bike .
he could be contagious , and everybody likes a free@@ bie .
no , of course not .
if it was that easy , we would 've won already .

whether he was sick or not is of no concern to me .
and that 's not you .
same mo that was used to kill cartel guy .
catherine .
what 's his granddaughter doing in the bag ?
well , you can talk to me , too .
and know this .
no , but he doesn 't confess .
oh , he 's not the headline , actually .
i liked lola .
avoiding all drug tunnels , of course .
we 're helping people get out who don 't need to be in there , lex .
this is somebody with a gun .
i looked into it , there was an arsenal - chelsea re@@ broadcast that night .
he still tells that story at dinner parties about the night you two were jumped in ku@@ ala lum@@ pur .
no , she 's my associate .
it 's all gonna be taken care of .
you put the gun down !
i have to get my best friend married .
yes , it 's a dream come true , pop ...

- visiting my girlfriend .
smur@@ f@@ storm , easy .
why do we like the ak - 10@@ 3 over the ak - 47 ?
my leg had been broken .
but they do not automatically deserve our votes .
i spent the last few hours stalking midtown , searching for a location which faced two such bill@@ boards at the right angles .
well , if that was acting , it was very convincing .
oh , really ?
i just want him to leave me alone .
are mr. reese and ms. shaw in danger ?

minimal loss of life , ma@@ xima@@ l impact on capability .
wow .
maybe we should just leave it at that .
who 's it from , bud ?
a lot more .
he has made a couple of requests to see you .
even those such as kent 's coven who sought to do good with it , they still had to hide their identities .
mm , some of them fight crime , too .
i don 't know what i would do without you .
i could see you waiting for me .
but it 's not what you want .
go , watch the door , i 'll handle this .
he writes nothing but hits .
look , i know you like to win , abbie , but going behind my back , undermining my authority ?
he 's a confidence man , just like his dad .
and , uh , she 's definitely gonna have cash .
why would i ?
i want the mohawk with the fade on the side .
why separate us ?
in certain do@@ mains , there 's much more .
but come to think of it , so are you .
you were supposed to get caught with it in ryan 's truck .
that 's not in mexico .
originally from le@@ wi@@ sham in the uk .
uh , she is updating the ange@@ la@@ tron 's interface .
why should we give you safe passage ?
to see lord fal@@ mouth ?
eventually they stop doing either .
you think i killed him .
can you do this after ?
they could reduce the obnoxious things coming out of your mouth .
i admire your ten@@ ac@@ ity .
you don 't have the drive .
yes , our most merciful god ...
you had the cameras scheduled , worried about how it would look , brought your black friend out , blasted commo@@ do@@ res .
no , thanks .
you want to talk about it ?
i 'm his foreign secretary .
doctors here have a lot of questions about his medical conditions .
he couldn 't possibly have gathered that data .
she 's distracting you .
but you went to trial .
- yes , is is .
that sword is what kills you .
well , i appreciate clan law .
the guy 's a shun and hasn 't left his house like 5 days .
you murdered your husband , mrs. grant .
problem is , unlike hiro@@ da , i don 't have his alias - - the legend he used when he first got here .
did he get a good look at the guy ?
i rode on a bus , a train , a plane , three cars , and a helicopter .
i want him to find his place in the world .
i mean , that would be great .
tell me about raymond reddington .
ma ' am , here you go .
he helped make them ?
- what are you talking about ?
the dna kit .
what you call sanity , it 's just a prison in your minds .
right now .
or was that just dumb luck ?
we want the photo destroyed .
you 're safe .
i got in , mum !
what is this , some kind of ... mother - son bonding experiment ?
and i 'm proud of you for being happy for her .
i won 't forget it .
this isn 't just about the survival of the kin@@ ship .
not without emma and hook .
well , thanks for the tour .
i can pity you .
oh , and , uh ...
it was either that
i 'm running out of mem .
look , you have no choice , lucas .
so where the hell is it ?
now you 're just making me nervous .

they didn 't let me have toys .
bad guys approaching .
you have no idea .
this guy gets paid , doesn 't he ?
just part of the job .
i swear by the holy sacred covenant of brotherhood .
where are you ?
i asked lee@@ kie if i could call him " dad . "
he has a way with words .
dad , i swear , if anything happens to either one of them ...
we gave you a marvelous car .
and i understand a change of aircraft .
no , right now , it 's a recon mission .
poseidon made that ... very clear .
so , what do you want to do about it ?
for all we know , she already has a dad .
speed things up .
i just wanted to surprise you .
you couldn 't do it because you thought you knew who was rounding that bend .
all you need to know is it 's classified .
which is why , when i first saw you , it presented itself as what i believed was vani@@ shing bone disease .
they bought him off .
just finish this , man .
maybe .
you 're bleeding .
now we 're getting somewhere .
we must have peace so we can build an economy and help our people .
we 've got braxton .
well , you won 't because i won 't let you .
he wants something , doesn 't he ?
not the toxins in our food .
i just know he wasn 't the same man after that .
- i can get us into that wing .
charcoal 's more my thing .
they 'll claim he was a rogue thug .
no , we 're not doing characters .
we need stealth .
if you want to give your life for some dirt bag then that 's up to you .
stay the hell away from us .
stop !
he needs to check our membership cards .
hey , that 's â € œ@@ dete@@ cti@@ ve@@ â € ￮ to you .
thought i saw something in my backyard .
no , not in here .
this is a custom job .
i pray it comes to nothing , but until then , i must ask you to keep a low profile .
we 're looking for dea agent richards .
please , just ...

yeah .
good morning , your highness !
okay .
what was your case , boss ?
of course you did .
and ?
you said it was like a cult compound ?
i needed to find out why he had returned , what he wanted .
you should work that into your coronation speech .
the thing is , world war three - what do you think ?
- you 'll have to talk to his wife .
je@@ mma ... we 've already built the program to determine where the portal will open on ma@@ ve@@ th .
so am i.
no , it 's not all that new .
doctor , please .
it just feels like my whole body is , like , trying to get out .
there 's an enforcement operation called li@@ mpet .
are we thinking it was daniel bud@@ d who armed the warhead ?
technically , they were just taken through a rift in space that appeared suddenly ... as they do .
there are no further details , but keep it right here , and we 'll continue to bring you the very latest .
well , i 'm told she has pre@@ ached rebellion in the past .
- get off of me !
when he took over , it felt like a family here .
where 's my fucking phone ?
black hose .
it 's right there on the videotape .
- you recording ?
stealing from foster kids .
it was so stupid .
well , you were right .
that 's it .

but i finally realized that you were a real ... a - hole .
yes , ma ' am .
i think i 'm a pretty good drunk .
no !
this got wed@@ ged under his eye on the way down .
so that 's pretty much been my week back at work ...
i knew you 'd eventually slip up .
how is sticking a needle in my neck protecting me ?
they 're not even listed yet .
if you would please give this to him .
- you 'll go upstairs ?
just drop it .
have you finished profiling those soldiers , ms. jones ?
warned me not to interfere .
never with you .
you heard the rumour of his infidelity , at the smoking concert ?
again , i don 't know what you mean .
' cause that 's kind of what it 's like .
and it 's a lot of pressure .
so billy stole them , then they stitched the pieces together .
because we 're not training you to be heroes .
do you know if she was seeing anyone ?
he talks about how he 's planned his own death for years .
she could give up anything to do a concert .
that 's okay .

it 's been over a week .
trauma - team leader today ?
you fell over and the man went away ?
- careful , kate .
and then you decided to hack the bank again to give people re@@ funds , which resulted in another man being stabbed .
no , it 's not , did she say something , it 's how she 's acting .
you know where that lake is ?
you 're the one who gave me something to believe in .

we have till noon .
they never let me talk , and i want ... to talk .
the time lords have got a big computer made of ghosts , in a crypt , guarded by more ghosts .
how long 's she lived here ?

it has begun !
what 's the latest on the lev@@ ee search ?
like i mentioned ,
have you ever seen a hispanic ghost ?
damn , finally .

he 's suffered enough under your care , and now you 're going to fix that by admitting what you did ... how you raped this boy ...
3,000 ?

let 's be sure .
i have to go now .
sure , i mean , she has sex and age from dr. brennan , and the remodeling shows that the fractures happened about ten years ago , which should be enough to narrow it down even more .
seriously , why is it so hot up here ?
i 'm sorry .
at the very least , it 'll open up a police inquiry .
i know , my love .
an alpha alert has that backdoor .
i just ...
- and what am i ?
this is michael speaking .
and theo 's not in it .
she was almost 16 , ready to take her vows .
lorraine ... what 's her name , from arc ?

i 'm saying you 're gonna need to change your plans here .
did he have a new favorite bar ?
it 's normal .
i hear you .
he 's heading for the desk .
i will only send this e - mail if you can assure me that she will be safe .
i agree , holy father .
never made my own rain before .
she was born here .
i 'd hold him in my arms for as long as i could .

i 'm here because i don 't like you .
those tickets weren 't a bribe , vasi@@ ly .

i 'm ready anytime ... sir .
oh shit .
oh , no , no , no .
i wouldn 't be too sure about that .
i 'm fine .

- more resilient that way .
you also planned the murder of raymond ke@@ ane .
do you want to die ?
" le se@@ ig@@ neur est ave@@ c vous .
sounds like a plan .
i wouldn 't do that .
if she 'd known what he did , what he was , it would have killed her .
i want you to come up with a solution to all this shit that you have poured on us .
i thought i almost lost you .
nora dur@@ st ?
he said ... he said ...
you wanna , like ...
but i like it .
the time is nigh !
you have some psychotic need to make other people like you no matter what ?
i go to seattle university .
this stuff ... this is your life , it 's not mine .
what are those ?
i 'm thinking about running for sheriff .
i mean , he 'd got me through my divorce , bankruptcy , the death of my parrot .
the one who been on the news ?
that 's where the clothes were made .
he understands .
or maybe someone 's trying to tell me something .
they don 't stand a chance .
perfect watch@@ dog material .
okay , phe@@ w .
but you couldn 't wait any longer or you might miss your one shot forever .
are you serious ?
i said , " all i know is they say she had a daughter . "
because , you know , " trust no one . "
i just figured ... that eventually someone would shoot the bastard .
why 's this place trashed ?
gh@@ ani , please .
so obviously , we wouldn 't want my former self tempted by a sexy assassin from the future .
not the time .
you went to atlanta to see a painting ?
- did not , you cheated !
to what purpose ?
great .
i get it .
i 'll handle it .
i 'm gonna kill him .
she 's up in her room .
we will be starting our final run to stop him in one hour .
do you remember what i said when i was here ?
gave him our names .
it 's got to be better than whatever s@@ will they serve in here .
i still have some friends there .
i know that you had a tough go when you were little , but sooner or later , you got to stop blaming your childhood .
hang on .
i 'm not tough , okay ?
do you know why no one could kill it ?
uhh !
you 'd be fired if you did that .
apparently she 's discharged herself !
so then you ran@@ so@@ med all the phones , and we thought you were gonna get paid that way .
but they didn 't count on sam 's knowledge of the nsa building .
i won 't pretend to understand how it all works , but i must say , dr. shaw really is something of a wizard .
it 's where i got my name .
well , you 'll get your chance tomorrow when the bishop hears you preach .
it is for another table , sir .
i was turning around , he was there .
and please , god , do not bring the blossoms into this .
phil , did you look in all the drawers ?

you could literally be in the game !
she 's off the reservation ?
okay , check it out .
i tend not to stay in one place for too long .
i thought this news would bring you some relief .
it 's my mom .
all these questions without any answers ... they 'll drive you nuts .
you 're going home ?
and if you can find who 's after her and neutra@@ lise them , what then ?
don 't miss him .
well , a suspended sentence .
oh , i 'm so glad that you mentioned this .
what does that mean for us ?
feels like i 'm missing something .

you think i don 't want to ?
we 'll meet you there .
a guy like matty losing his cool like that was viral gold .
i just meant that , you know ...

i mean having her sister almost die in front of her .
no , you don 't understand .
we believe agent simmons has been compromised , replaced with an l@@ md .
see , i 've been trying to wrap my brain around his behavior ,
no one 's gonna collect the reward ' cause we 're the ones who did it .
so , you can stay as long as you like .
you heard about that ?
over and out .
- hold that line .
let 's start near the shore .
- why he 's acting so weird .
he makes me feel safe .
she said she was happier than she 's ever been .
we know that sarah rhodes made monthly withdrawals .
don 't shake his hand .
the border between birmingham and paradise .
you 're not like everyone else .
it doesn 't matter who it was .

at first , he did it to control me .
i need her more .
i 'm not gonna say stav@@ ros had an easy time last night .
she 's running for president .
i want to be a singer , just like you .
and if you think self - ag@@ grandi@@ sement will al@@ lay prejudice , you 're a bigger old fool than ...
the only person inside is mr. jenkins .
there 's a possible associate on his file called connor whe@@ lan .
if you can get the word out about that , that would really help .
probably another intake briefing .
well , clearly everything i 've told you is a lie .
we 're under quarantine for a reason .
and there was an animal in the middle of the road .
and i live two blocks from the do@@ jo .
so i - i don 't want to rock the boat .
hetty 's gonna want some answers .
ray ?
we 'd love to , petra .
i don 't know if you 're actually gonna kill anybody .

the water is foul , the air pollu@@ ted , but the world goes on .
or that he 's a counter@@ te@@ nor .
well , when i was a girl , the watch@@ er@@ woman inspired me to learn magic to fight her .
but it 's like , uh , what dr. oz says about insanity .
then when he left , the lone@@ liest feeling in the world .
- well , you have to .
if he hasn 't beaten us to it .
how so ?
he 's saying some pretty outrageous things .
he is completely off the grid , and we have no real way of finding him .
all right , buddy .
what does he do that you don 't like ?
most women like a bit of power and money .
money !
he ain 't working for me .
back by popular demand , the one , the only , the deli@@ ri@@ ously sexy ...
oh , my god , we 're ...
the shooter 's been spotted .
we 're considering the possibility that perhaps sig@@ int was inaccurate .
thanks for dinner .

paintball on your birthday ...
your calves , on the other hand ...
maxine .
what 's he got to do with any of this ?
- what about you ?
all right , tell you what i 'm gonna do .
and in the state i was in , i just wasn 't thinkin ' clearly .
um , i believe that we can find a way to contact them again to get the kind of help they used to give .
i agree completely .
ante - mortem , definitely .
but , hey , you knew all about this , right , ju@@ ghead ?
and when she grew bored of that , she fed them to her dragons .
let 's go grab him .
see what you can find out .
not having sex with me drove her into a murderous , psychotic rage .
not even a twitch .
i 'm certain finn mikaelson will .
he still lives here in new york .
you should come to class , see for yourself .
yes .
there are no photographs of me as a child .

they were below deck or working at night .
and there 's this thing with cl@@ ary ...
my father fought side by side with all the clans , and i with him .
this is my partner , detective griffin .
but then mother got sick , and mr bay@@ ley dismissed her without a second thought .
that 's insane .
you should tell her that mom is in iran where the coup is happening .
if people want to show affection for you , how do you want to avoid dealing with it ?
getting the helm back made me understand what it takes to rule .
spears wasn 't fixing computers .
maybe we can help .
well , then i guess it 's good we 're out of there .
you 're going home .
whether you want to recognize it or not , our fates are tied together .
see , that 's the exact reason why i wouldn 't want to come , but ...

it 'd be better if i drowned .
cc , 3 floors down , northeast corner .

we made it here .
the snakes , yes .
oh , my god .

yeah , very well .
i 've said everything i saw , gentlemen .
- # in my heart , in my soul ... #
oh , did you hear that ?
i didn 't do this for my amusement .
that means the entire coven will die .
and may we offer our good wishes on your marriage .
and don 't you have conflicts with him all the time ?
so much that i 've lost my own .
it will be fine .
grab her legs .
is that why you 're walking around town , eating french fries ?
- sit down .
to the man who gunned down your great love , bombed your office building .
it tells the prosecution 's story ...
i don 't know , but i know who might .
- looking forward to the challenge .
and what if it doesn 't , drew ?
are the ske@@ wers there ?
maybe you 'll be able to get something out of him .
yeah , i have to get them out .
put out a picture and a description .
get the other door .
and i have theirs .
and your mom meets the criteria ?
tell them you saw a shooter in the window .
let gotham fall so you may rise .
hey , this is weird .
it was a friday night .
you 're the only one i trust .
the drought is crippling our state .
kev , we got a fight on the floor !
she 'll get over it .
i invited him to join us at the ... celebration of my exploits .
the same one that you and i saw ?
depends on your answer .
just wait a minute .
he crossed the line into pre@@ clearance .
gretchen was unconscious , and deluca found a crash cart , right ?

at least she thinks we bonded .
she wants labs back on her ...
the u.s. stock exchange receives a dozen threats a week - - they 're usually bogus .
couldn 't you do it this weekend ?
and you 're allowed time to figure that out .
on its own , maybe .

he spoke to me .
why the hell would i listen to you ?
i want to go home .
uh , yes , lady in red .
will you bring him some justice ?
i need to get milly 's pin@@ a@@ fore from her rooms .
are you saying that we have to release that man , sir ?
all we have to do is get inside his computer and see what we find .
how many times do you think he did this ?
i 'm a freak .
- the whole thing happened really fast ..
you 're not helping yourself .
i mean , it 's probably just a stomach bug , right ?
you said it yourself , superintendent .
oh , hello .
you 'll talk to eric ?
where the hell are we going ?
anything productive ?
how did you find out ?
it 's a shame we 'll never meet , but these recordings are meant to guide you , to help you and your parents ,
you gonna sell out your own man ?
i found my place .
physically turn him into the monster he was beneath .
then ... your mother became pregnant , and we got married .
watch and learn .
you ready ?
it still works ?
uh , right .
the five years you spend here as surgical residents will be the best and worst of your lives .
you know i wanna die with my eyelashes on .

[ jim ] who stands like that ?
how do you know about project mercury ?
i 'll pay for a new one , i promise .
so whether we walk into an ambush depends on the crafts@@ manship of a knock - off motel cuckoo clock .
so listen to the words that are coming out of her mouth and believe them .
okay .
thank you .
you had it stolen so you could double - dip and collect the insurance .
i don 't think he understands .
this damn city inspector to give us the go - ahead on the attic .
i tried to build a family , that didn 't work out .
bottom line is , your obligation ended there .
this is my watch now .
i was about to get my gun .
i 'm gonna take it from here .
who ... who the hell are you ?
what do you think ?
i just don 't like the way it feels .
love those steak cubes .
tell me about her .
you think it 's scientific ?
evelyn , this isn 't what it looks like .
he told me that i would be visited by two men .
oh , god .
there was a very brief time where i envi@@ sioned a future for myself as a dental hygien@@ ist .
i 'm done trying to help you .
and it 's a lot harder to sell a painting the whole world knows is missing .
are you blushing ?
nine .
the villagers won 't do it .
i 'm not doing it , stu .
i love you .
i highly doubt it .
kendra , come on .
what about you ?
yeah , i remember , but ...
when you told me what she did that night on my porch , i ...
never miss a chance to make me feel stupid .
you will no doubt have noticed the absence of mr ren@@ fre@@ w .
that 's why you get paid the big bucks .
♪ to show up , so i can give them all my old bras ♪
you 're all grown up now .
like when no one thought i 'd jump off the river bridge .
i didn 't do as you told me .
so you 're saying reed had a hickey ?
see if somebody can go and get your plaque for you .
i 'll have to take that chance .
he became convinced that the captain was leading us to death .
you supported him .
for once .
as you wish .

ah , we could start a band .
that one dramatic gesture .
oh , my goodness !
didn 't your hair used to be darker ?
sorry .
eigh@@ t@@ yone thousand views .
it were me that used to bring her mars bars and let her use t ' bucket .
well , i 've made mistakes .
you wouldn 't live there if you didn 't miss the way this country used to be .
c ?
no way , lady .
if you 're not there , i act alone .
i promised i 'd get her in the show .
oh , by the way ...
doesn 't she look a little bit like cat woman ?
let 's hope those ukrainian rebels aren 't getting the band back together .
i was kind of hoping you might talk some sense into her ?
i don 't like it .
juliette walked out .
none of them have last names .
i am why this did not work .
bring a net !
if you were taking care of him , you 'd get him something to eat .
- she just lost her brother .
perhaps he was overcome by smoke before he got the chance .
what did you just do ?
he 's one of yours .
i believe this is greek fire , a legendary flame that cannot be extingui@@ shed .
say cameron .
can for ten people stealing the place with ten methods .
well .
actually , sna@@ pper , i can .
he 's not worried about some blut@@ bad / bau@@ er@@ sch@@ we@@ in feud .
i can 't breathe .
i 'm not all right with it .
mostly on school nights .
now , let 's never talk about ...
she got out by cutting the power .
yes , evie and michael are twins .
you talk to bridget ?
did i do something to put you off ?
you know , i predict i run into you a year from now , she 'll be the one running the ship .
cautious .
today i made an incredible discovery .
we got something else .
it tastes like cream of mushroom soup .
i 'm just glad i saw em run into the woods .
the 're just doing their job .
you take in this unfortunate child and give him a chance at a better life .
skin coloring on both patients makes me think - - hae@@ mach@@ ro@@ mato@@ sis , but i just don 't know .

you know we 're not alone out there .
let 's get this done .
what good will he be if he dies of starvation ?
i 'm not really sure that conway 's a sir lancelot .
and whose fault is that , mama ?
agent bro@@ tt was monitoring it for any suspicious activity .
she 's not gonna give up .
what you turned me into .
mom , you 're gonna be okay .
no .
and i 'm sure there 's some awesome dude out there who will accept you for who you are , vaginal teeth and all .
wait a minute .
and the point of all this is to make arrests and to stop briggs from being killed .
donovan , you still with me ?
those are your exact words .
oh , by ' eck !
i had no idea that was part of his plan .
absolutely , we need to keep this out of the glare of the media until we know what we 're dealing with .
you want to kill my friends .
i told my supervisor , and my supervisor said he was gonna call the doctor .
you sound like you know what you 're talking about .
no matter the motive of the heist ,
why would you say that , ma ' am ?
i mean , maybe we can go to duane rea@@ de and get me , like , an under@@ shirt or something ?
what are you , a shrink or something ?
come and meet penny .
how would i know you handed over andreas to prevent a gang war ?
now , i 'm gonna time this .
and then i want to go home .
see you later .
um , kamal , i want you to meet dr. avery .
i 'll trade you for that health hazard you 've got on .
zed , this is dr. carroll .
who are you addressing ?
i 'm calling them back .
beckett .

you want to know who 'd be the last one standing out of the five of us ?
yeah , anna found a memo proving new@@ berry was guilty .

it doesn 't mean they 're not true .
but when i ask you if you want to have babies , you 're all , " i don 't know , yes , no , maybe , uh ... "
if we snap him up , the people klaus is working for will know it 's us , and he 's burned .
i know where we 're going .
being a good investigator .
gambling , debt , hanging with the wrong folks .
i 'm secretary ...
what 're we going to do ?
but about six months ago , they went dark .
four months ago ?
are you ready , peter ?
note to self .
and i guess that 's why we do ... feel good about it .
listen , i 'm not here to run rough@@ sho@@ d over you .
are you okay ?
just take it slow .
oh , i didn 't actually .
he told you before he told me ?
of course , you almost do not sleep , live in an empty apartment , do not eat anything .
you know how stubborn he can be .
i 'm so sorry .
danny ?
but i 'm only 49 .
who looped you in ?
- right , that i 'm a tor@@ turer .
who knows what off@@ ends these creatures ?
if you stole something like that , where would you fence it ?
ah , but do not touch it with your fingers .
which is fine , but what happened to when we 're in here , we tell each other the truth ?
just ... forget it .
come on , you frozen bastard , live !
that dry wall looks a bit familiar , ga@@ dge .
if i do that for you , will you par@@ lay with your old crew and release my friend ?
definitely not rhetorical .
the only thing you 're trying to fix is your reputation .
so it 's gotten a little complicated .
and he 's threatening to call the police .
that son of a bitch is lucky you 're watching .
you 're right .
you would do anything to make the pain go away .
is there a way to tunnel ?
a man takes an opportunity where he gets it .
cut his throat .
were any of you there when it happened ?
it 'd help disperse the force of impact and direct the walkers clean .
and i 'll bring it back to lux@@ emb@@ our@@ g .
i am a lawyer .
they 're all clever and pleasant .
