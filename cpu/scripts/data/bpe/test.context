i 'm not here to talk to your father , asher .
it turns out it 's just the opposite .
he had these psychotic episodes .
i think that 's five minutes of my life i 'm not getting back .

i hate it when they go rogue .
she was cool for , like , a hot second , and then - -

ronnie had found love again .

he 's the source .
it 's not my fault .
i 'm guessing that 's why you 're here .
what 's going on ?
weapons dealer , scum of the earth .
it 's too bad " supernatural relic hunter " isn 't something that looks good on a résumé .
that scenario has happened .
you didn 't really think that i 'd fall for such any easy set - up , did you ?
what the hell happened to you ?
now , we just got to get it .
even if i agreed , there isn 't time .
how well do you know him ?
okay , what , uh , particular kind of weasel are we talking ?
truly excellent work .
he gave me his child and he disappeared .
that 's not helpful .
this lad ducked down in the hold .
agatha !
i called his office in london , but he 's out of the country .
but your son has asked me if he can donate .
you know , a lot of my dad 's so - called friends were always after something .
she 's not the right one .
- gulli@@ ver .
um , do you ...
oh , look at the time .
you did it .
and that deserves to be acknowledged .
his routine is very important to him .
years ago , his nephew was in a car accident .
anyone else ?
i 'm sure you 're right .
that 's sancti@@ moni@@ ous .
amb@@ er@@ le didn 't run away .
jocelyn 's brilliant plan is screwed .

there is no need for any further pre@@ vari@@ cation , darling .
yeah , the drug game was good to us at first .
you were dead , but then you came back .
my initial measurements were accurate .

then this was imprisonment .
clayton is a renaissance man , gibbs .
i wasn 't looking at her .
- not legal .

- as you should have .
gina , i know it seems cruel , but it 's a swift death .
is that bad ?
mind if we come inside ?
take your time .
he 's here .
i was only trying to help .
i need food .
he said he 'd take me out on it sometime .
someday , everyone else will , too .
um , can i give you a lift ?
- i will .
his friend said , " did you jump ? "
he said , " she 's in charge . "
guess so .
see that one over there ?
all right .
we lost him during the raid .
cameron , you didn 't come here just for the bike .
yeah , i knew you weren 't gonna go for that .
tu@@ tto ma@@ tro la@@ men@@ te ?
are you gonna find the guy who shot my mom ?
she 's obviously upset about dad 's complete disregard for her and her mom .
nothing but upside .
kyle , honey , why don 't you go start the dishes , and zoila and i will clean up in here ?
well , looks like you 're making yourself comfortable in my offices .

or maybe you 're thinking of firing me ?
this is your chance , girlie .
no , no , it wasn 't that easy .
but between us , i think this " magic " is just a fancy word for some unknown field effect rando@@ mi@@ zing the quantum properties of matter .
you open that door and i 'll kill her , too .
i 'm emotional .
what was the exact moment you became a ma@@ met play ?
for emmett 's sake ?
there 's a good chance we will .
be generous .
i 'm sure you 're mistaken .
what is going on ?
let 's go .
what are they called ?
- okay , come on .
and yours , too .
it looked like they had recently had a party there .
it was violent .
you better get out of my face , you stupid ... ( both grunting )
there was an accident .
really ?
hardly makes sense for him to do that if he was setting you up .
we 're pretty sure we just found our fourth murder that 's been disguised as something else .
not so simple .
word 's out you 've taken on the prime number theo@@ rem .
are you still mad that i went after gabe at brandon 's party ?
all right , i 'm just trying to figure out why this is turning into a brush fire all of a sudden .
needle driver .
winston , open him up .
maybe we should call tsa .
funny how agent regan keeps losing him .
whatever was in those photos is what got coco killed .
ed beg@@ ley , jr .
if it 's indeed the right stuff you will soon be zombie rats .
i know that 's gonna be extra hard for you .
why all the killing ?
no , he 's - he 's brain@@ washing him , that 's all .
do whatever you must .
i wasn 't feeling well .
upon your discharge , i was thinking that you and i might motor up the pacific coast highway .
we got something .
all due respect , but i don 't want to just sit here .
can ...
why don 't you tell him a little bit about yourself ?
you spend the night with him , but it 's not serious ?
he wasn 't always crazy .
specially not in my condition .
it 's exactly what you do .
you stole me from my parents .
somehow , you 've managed not to kill any of ' em so far .
not long enough for that particular odor to settle .
whatever 's going on now , he 's got nothing to do with .
wol - ver - ines !
why do you sound surprised ?
i thought i almost lost you .
emphasis on " could . "
stile@@ tto knife .
he 'll be working on his allies , using ga@@ ston to gather support .
you 're okay ?
we did want her to sell .
and ...
we read your magnetic code .
perhaps you would like to tell her that .
i look forward to working with you , arch@@ deacon .
hand over the key .
no , you can handle it .
# walking by my side
whatever she did , she did it for me .
we should get to the shoot .
did what work ?
right .
we believe the president 's being held in this room on the second floor .
you only paid to see the hallway .
speaking of gift - wrapped ...
and they 're not recreational , there 's a prescription .
i should know .
thank you .
what do you want ?
i never blacked out from it .
no rou@@ sing pep talk ?
the entire map for our spiritual development .
jake gave me his half of the truck , so i can do what i want with it .
it was my suggestion .
i ...
he 's still in the field .
what are we offering ?
i 'm su@@ bbing in for my dad .
to my friends at the 12th precinct ...
we had a pact , me and him .
i broke my oath of celibacy to the high council .
uh , she 'll be right back .
if he finds ' em , he 's gonna kill ' em .
that he threatened your mother 's life more than once and the bureau ignored it ?
i need to be sure that you 're right .
you 're just trying to help .
i 'm worried she 'll ...
" i would pay money
excuse me .
oh , that she did .
it 's refreshing .
- you had a choice .
but we didn 't say anything about her heart , did we ?
but it 's ...
the team .
i can legi@@ slate the shit out of shit in here .
so , what about you ?
the king in the north !
see , that 's the problem .
haven 't we , my darling ?
am@@ un@@ ra has spoken through me .
now it 's maybe too little .
this is a shirt , not a blouse , and bowie had this haircut in 1973 , okay ?
i 'm just ... just giving you a hard time .
i 'm doing it for us .
even heard you have no cock .
there 's a bunch of them in that area .
- i don 't need the money .
sleeping with eden , i knew i was gonna do it .
he 's her brother ... and if you don 't at least hear her out , you risk losing her .
i needed this .
you 're still running around playing the victim and hurting people while you do it .
that clinical trial i mentioned , it 's really worth a shot .
dr. mcmanus and i are no longer seeing each other .
let 's see them together .
yo , nick , you like my shirt ?
being pulled around in chains killed my appetite .
lies .
i 'll take a stra@@ it@@ jacket .
but what is scary to some inspires hope in others .
casey .
then you just have to get him out of your head .
what ?
he doesn 't fully trust me .
at most , we 've got criminally negligent homicide by hazing .
so that would be a " no . "
i already did .
hey , you gonna let me have those photos or what ?
i would if anyone cared .
at what time ?
his stomacha@@ ches seem to be getting worse , especially when you come around .
driver dead .
it 's just that kra@@ sno@@ v has a partial hand .
you should shower , wear something nice .
where is she ?
they took the damn thing right in front of me .
their daughter was in a horrific accident .
when did i say that i 'm gonna be the one that fails ?
ra@@ z .
virginia foster is involved in conspiracy , fraud , money laundering ...
i 'm surprised it took you so long to do it .
i mean , i 'm not willing to just abandon people that depend on me .
let 's just take that as a given .
are you changing it ?
not at all .
we have that in common .
i 'm not letting it go till you admit that you wish i was a - -
okay , guys , you 're supposed to be in love .
i have a scar on my chest to prove it .

i called jonathan to make amends .
ahmad ?
who 's doing the shooting ?
he needs a transplant , or he 'll die .
i know that you know what the right thing to do is .
chef joe , you all right ?
on the plane i read this amusing description of rome :
i think it already has .
i told you , i can 't .
nick ?
yeah , but you didn 't have a flash drive , you signed it into evidence .
" i am never so proud as when i choose not to prosecute a case . "
fo@@ xes scream .
you organized a contact without informing anyone .
you can end this right now .
we 're legends , grey .
but seriously , help me out here .
i 'll let you in on a little secret :
when you found out he had a stroke , you panicked because you were worried that his new wife was gonna steal your gold .
yeah .
what is he do ...
you see two , you moron ?
but no greater honor .
maybe we can make an exception .
how can a mother abandon her children ?
fine , fine .
- inter@@ active .
almost ?
people don 't realize the art muscle needs training .
there was no blood spatter inside the fridge , which could mean that he was shot elsewhere .
i think i want it just as it is .
kat ...
all right , i laid out the schedule for the ru@@ mb@@ rella .
we 're in the process of tracing her steps from there .
this funeral wasn 't cheap .
we friends ?
whoa , whoa , whoa .
clarissa , how nice of you to join us .
i 'm gonna check interpol .
the desperate rat 's gonna light you up once we get out of here ,
well , he 'd have to be somewhere pretty high up to maintain line of sight with the drone .
what 's wrong ?
cruz .
don e , shh !
peter ?
thane , wel@@ don , hy@@ rum ,
oh , this 'll give you visions , all right .
or maybe ...
i just wanna get out and ... go home .
please tell me we 're getting out of here .
who else would it have been , v ?
no one in , no one out .
a man 's gotta protect himself .
you talked to your friends this morning .
and maybe it 's about me , too .
what if our guy 's not stopping at one ?
hey , baby .
it ain 't a good idea to stop at night .
if you do , you could go anywhere , any time .
this whole thing is dead to me , anyhow .
- look , if - if dmitri snaps , we lose an asset who is poised to rise through the ranks of the russian military .
a high school algebra teacher .
we can fight back .
otto ?
we 'll never win a race in that thing .

you work for him .
he also joined an improv troop .
no , ay , wounds that will be ripped open when she wakes .
every time he laughed at me for being short , you laughed with him .
it is delivered and we delivery to deba@@ illy .
we 'll see what they might have .
isn 't that the same tag used by we@@ m@@ linger when he killed those two marshals ?
aren 't you scared of what you might do to me ?
why does mike have that ?
okay , so , i 'm gonna go watch some bill o 'reilly .
it was because of adalind .
your attitude at work here sucks .
i asked her to help me escape , and she said she would , but then ...
not a coincidence the guard got the call .
- come on , there you go .
forget india .
boss said verify the prosecution 's case .
all right .
what are you saying , that i can 't have this job and marry you ?
whatever happened that night , i believe that she was protecting herself , but she still killed charlotte .
molly , are you there ?
you drugged him , then planned to recover the money with a tracking device .
" status nomin@@ al will continue to monitor .
ah@@ n , by whom ?
we gotta go really slow , because i really ( bleep ) my neck .
do you still have it ?
you don 't mind if i stay ?

the roman numer@@ als are bible verses , and the words are all in latin .

his kids opened a few over here in the ' 90s .
so leave him be .
you , and me and dad laugh .

well , how are you ?
was it detective dawson ?
i would like to do some work on my body language .
and i can 't hang out in this shit - stain no - place much longer , okay ?
and you can only fight them where they live , not just at wayne enterprises .
it 's the third time the government put me in here .
you see , he told me the story of you and your new lab assistant .
your architect did a spectacular job .
you weren 't invited .
philly 's m@@ ta .
yeah , just out there .
set it up .
yeah .
thank you , mr. bu@@ ko@@ vitz .
and i am already in the sad underwear .
did they even get the landing zone ?
you 'd think on the day you assassinate the president , you 'd at least spring for a mid - size .
rog .
slate and bloody canvas ?
yeah , ed , i heard .
pa , don 't do this .
yeah , he needs a whole fleet .
have two if you want .
that girl 's your daughter ?
had i inflated her id so tremen@@ d@@ ously , she thought she had what it took to be me ?
he wanted me to take over the family business .
so you 're gonna have to come up with a better excuse ...
kar@@ amp@@ a medical foundation ... three million .
i mean , she has no dog in this fight .
your mom , your mother , uh , the one that raised and fed you ?
i think you actually need an assistant more than anybody in the world needs an assistant .
you should not be here .
i know .
we are back in this thing !
you or charlie .
where are we going ?
- mr. president .
losing the coa@@ hu@@ ila cell set us back .
that 's where we found princess zara .
so where did the poison that killed zack come from ?
so ?
we 're not losing anybody .
yeah , but as dana 's friend ?
oh , jackson 's always worked hard ...
i see you , ralph co@@ ates .
you 've been doing that for years .
wicked little cow .
every tattoo that we solve gets us a step closer to shepherd .
something 's up .
it 's gonna hurt .
did you hang out with him in prison ?
we 've identified a couple of males in the area .
and if we don 't ?
the only problem was that you couldn 't get through to kowalski .
so i take it you and dr. cash weren 't on the best of terms ?
get back on the bus .
i think that 's where this all started .
they will have no recollection whatsoever of anything that goes on here tonight .
- yeah .
which will you start with ?
what are we supposed to do ?
no means yes .
" alfie , you were meant to have these things . "
she trusted you to make the right decision .
if he was coming to d.c. , he would have told me .
but she loved her mother .
i 'll go see this thing she wants to show me .
sometimes that 's the only place .
but you see ,
i had to get it out .
why would i steal it ?
work with her ?
and fewer .
i can 't .
- i know .
this is gonna be so much fun .
you 're not a leader .
caleb was too afraid to tell you .
i had to protect myself against your fa , didn 't i ?
i owe them such an apology .
you were nothing but a common thief .
in here .
exactly , so why is he going after her ?
i didn 't lie .
so my cousin jose@@ fin@@ a , she raised her as her own .
that 's a little sad .
oh , dear .
what ?
a hot version of you is stealing your little boyfriend right out from under your nose .
enab@@ ling all of you in your victi@@ m@@ hood .
sounds promising .
you 're a researcher .
i call your handler every time i want to hear your voice ?
which they performed because of " structural alterations " .
i 'm not going .
uh , here she is .
there is a six - month waiting list .
- we could use him to get rachael .
well , i know of him .
i can 't fix it .
i never want to feel that again .
let 's take a trip to ro@@ ano@@ ke .
for now ... let 's see if he 's got any of his own .
well , we have a case and there may be some cross - over .
but i still believe in her .
- well , start .
i want you on my side .
and what about your gift , sir ?
i understood .
it 's all i 've got .
it was so hard for me .
i do live alone , but not here .
i 'll contact o@@ em@@ c , get access .
you know , this is a little bit confusing .
sid lia@@ o .
it came directly from mayor poole .
i thought you were banned from the league , hermann ?
" welcome " ?

but a lot of the people down here don 't even know what their unfinished business is .
" time bandits " is an american classic .
well , there you go .
i think we have to elope .
- let me get you a drink .
- thank you for coming , jane .
i 'll put a team on him till we get the paperwork .
all right , look .
i can set an order in 20 minutes .
good for morale .
sando@@ val to the south .
how many innocent people did you kill on your no humanity bender , hmm ?
we haven 't had a status update since dennis skipped town .
he did .
time hasn 't been doing anything .
why did you save me ?
i had no idea .
where were you the night of tim 's death ?
it 's not like you even played .
we 're not having this conversation .
we could do this all day .
should 've known better than to fall for a ninja .

i 'm committed to this .
it 's so cool mom 's letting us play that charity event next week .
i still don 't .
for your safety , i 'm dispat@@ ching units .
penguin lost his mind on national tv , just like you said he would .
i would be lying if i said it didn 't cross my mind that maybe mike should think about making a deal .
but when he 's awake , he can communicate non - verbally .
well , none of this makes any sense .
you did realize that by taking a deputy 's suv that every move you made would be tracked , right ?
oh , nonsense .
i mean , there 's so many ways to think about that .
you do realise this whole business is about revenge .
- why not ?
i only got here a few minutes before you , and i have my own jet .
huck says you carry a gun around inside your apartment .
if you 're looking for per@@ nell , he 's not here .
liam finally gets one thing right .
rewrite it .
it 's double jeopardy !
kyle never had anyone on his side .
my father will laugh at me .
well , that 's impossible .
my name is vasi@@ ly .
no , it isn 't .
this was never about him anyway .
ryan got fired ?
i got the coordinates .
i know that his powers aren 't magic .
by working in a camp right on the border of isis territory ?
and i got some pi@@ ping shit that i need to figure out today , which you probably don 't think is crucial , you big , dumb fuck .
you can 't deny what we had was real .
here .
in@@ nies , ou@@ ties .
it 's a bit dra@@ b , isn 't it ?
- it said more than that .
this is a blatant attempt to intimidate us .
it won 't happen again .
to yourself .
i know .
' next , please . '
the kind of power to get you home .
didn 't have to be this way .
and you know what , jay ?
you know the squire 's position when it comes to the property .
she 's not a drug dealer .
you don 't strike me as a killer , ken .
he was trying to stop us .
they do love making one of their own a hero .
we don 't need it now .
did sam know ?
this is why we 're here !
but he 's not sick , right ?
if there 's one thing your sister is not , it 's fragile .
my name is paul everett .
barry , there 's no time .
like the north star .
" the public . "
but ... their days are done , bau@@ dela@@ i@@ res .
all over it , it says you need an he@@ a .
yeah , he 's totally wanting it .
mom , could you please ?
jesus , i 'm poison to them .
my last boss was a criminal .
we almost did ... but i 've been grounded .
- what am i supposed to call you ?
lots of light .
to fill my fucking head with whatever i wanted to hear , just as long as i kept making donations .
you were good today .
is that what this is ?
i mean , he 's doing to you and vincent what he tried to do to rebecca and alistair .
olivia ...
nay , ross , you cannot lay it all at their door .
i ain 't need a daddy then and i don 't need one now .
must have been a migh@@ ti@@ ly good man .
what 's happening to us ?
i 'm not giving you hal@@ mi .
i thought alex was handling it .
torres 's sister went to argentina recently to look for him .
is it wrong to hope for love in a marriage ?
you knew we were gonna find out eventually .
yes .
no ?
gee , thanks for telling me that story .
what do you think ?
thank yer .
he recruited you ?
santo dios !
why don 't klaus , sunny and i wait with mr. poe , while stephan@@ o goes with nurse lu@@ ca@@ font to examine the body ?
no one mour@@ ns him .
i don 't share dinner staring down the barrel of a shotgun .
your teammates were in that pool giving a 110 % .
and you ... you 're not her type .
their leader will come down , and we 'll fight .
and yet , here you are , and you 're not the slightest bit afraid .
i 'm sure they miss your sunny coun@@ ten@@ ance as well .
without you .
yeah , but that 's not what i asked .
mr. smith , we came in here on good faith .
ooh , sex trafficking workshop .
it started after wells killed me in the other timeline .
.. who 's dead to me - as are my parents .
drop you off , make snacks for dylan 's track - team - parent meeting , get the groceries , pick up dylan , take her to or@@ th@@ od@@ on@@ tist , get presents , track - team meeting .
i think i may have just really screwed up .
you chased me .
- it 's not chilly , it 's as cold as the waters of co@@ cy@@ tus , the frozen lake of hell .
you got any actual food in this place ?
making sure no one hears you screaming .
i 'm glad i approved that pan@@ or@@ ama idea .
poly@@ atomic .
or what ?
i had no idea he 'd done this .
14 years out here , i 've seen five bodies mau@@ led by lions .
and i think i 'm about to be fired .
do you feel like you need me to stick around ?
i know it can be built .
he survived .
madam , do you know this man ?
i 've already decided .
i don 't want to be seth pto@@ le@@ my .
i - i - i think we should stick to tuesday .
in the beginning , i tried to escape again and again .
i 'm not too worried about it .
always have been .
no .
you know more about her than anybody else .
so tell them it 's okay , okay ?
and allison ?
s - seriously , i - i don 't ...
and nothing or nobody can change that .
what did you say to him yesterday ?
i need two tickets in the orchestra section for wicked .
you 're welcome .
the police ... ( whispers ) got the wrong guy .
so we can all get on with our lives .
i 'm here .
course , when they look back at the amazon and what we did to it , they 'll think we must have hated them .
it just never went away .
- when ?
did you talk to anyone ?
why do you say that ?
i don 't know .
maybe that 's what you want to call it .
mm - hmm , typical .
- captain , my clients are exhausted and under emotional distress .
in his humiliation , he was deprived of justice .
there was a great storm .
dwayne , i need you and j@@ p to photograph the scene , release the body and dust for prints .
promise me that you 'll stay out of it .
it 's due tomorrow .
when you asked me to join the deo , i didn 't hesitate .
at the very least there was somebody else involved .
we need to take a look at the homicide victim .
and if miss fontaine could try and look like she 's in a drugged stu@@ por .
no .
it 's too soon to tell .
i ordered you not to do that .
i was banished to that empty , wretched place , rumple .
we are gonna have to kill him .
how long do we have to put on this show ?
this isn 't what we do , katie .
he 's a pathetic son of a bitch , and as far as i 'm concerned , good riddance .
next steps ?
right .
so we 're not looking at a mugging .
something that would take effect if he never made it off that rooftop alive .
the book , not chapter 32 .
so this is your version of asking me something nicely .
i 'm the guy who avoided his dying mother for weeks .
well , a doctor at the facility where he 's being treated is an old friend .
um , ave@@ eno , i think .
and they looked like ... what they were .
it 's labeled " important papers . "
i 'm not gonna spend the next three years fighting that woman off .
very simply , your honor , we don 't have him .
uh , no , it doesn 't look like it .
don 't you see ?
call it a d ...
thank you very much .
" wake me " ?
i took a bullet .
did you hear me ?
hey , where you goin ' , man ?
it 's the super@@ food of the amazon .
that 's what the law says .
sister , i was looking for you .
so you 're saying everything he 's been doing is so that he can use it against you ?
so , uh ...
it 's rubber , actually .
that 's not what my lifestyle as an artist is about .
you wouldn 't let me .
i 'm supposed to believe that now ?
if i 'm going to the gala , i 'll need to know how to dance .
i don 't know if she 'll ever trust me again .
and her plan is to question the daughter of our primary target .
you see , that 's how things work around here .
i 'm out all day tomorrow .
you .
and then the children will be mine ?
we are close to ruin .
and don 't forget the whole
wasn 't very sexual .
of course you did .
yeah , body parts sent to family members .
my father 's illness has destabi@@ lized my family 's grip on power .
- exactly .
squad , since peralta 's briefing was cut short , you can all use this time to clean up your desks .
about what this could be .
magic .
i don 't want to take that chance .
camille , are you down here ?
so i 've read .
ivy didn 't know what she was stealing .
courage ?
duke ...
listen , we figured with everything that was going on here , no one would care .
santos was right .
i survived .
you replaced the char@@ gers ?
speak her words out loud .
all right .
good for you .
so you buy that ?
this is why i need a code name .
our little conversation , you know , got me thinking about my own life .
even abbie abandoned me .
but we all kind of knew that te@@ mmy thought she was the one .
we 're here for you .
just trying not to die , it 's no way to live .
we 'll need an isolated place to do this .
nick ?
they 're magic .
you 're gonna have to get used to that .
and good times .
which you didn 't want to send over the wire .
and then , dad 's home .
you scored zero on the mission , soldier .
are you happy ?
but you 're getting the declin@@ ing ?
fuck !
pretty cool , right ?
i - i can 't take it anymore !
he won 't be ready for at least a week .
according to dun@@ ning , he keeps records of the whole operation on his computer .
3 months ago is right around the time
listen , are you sure you 're gonna be okay ?
well , penalties for counterfeiting pharmaceuticals are less severe than trafficking narcotics .
is there gonna be gunfire ?
let 's worry about it then .
sorry .
wait , wait .
wes '@@ mom died of cancer and he never met his father .
you can 't just smash a hard drive like this .
maybe it is time for a change .
it 's like a bi - corn .
i have to make things right , no matter what the cost .
possibly green .
but , i mean , it is meredith 's house .
it 's impossible , actually .
why target women with low self - esteem ?
- [ laughing ] - [ chuckles ]
steven got tipped to a big package .
all i 'm saying ,
not yet .
she really got sick and went home .
i can 't believe arizona let them pull that slimy bull ...
shepherd wanted to kill you and i stopped her .
i know you 're right .
i can recite the true names of the stars .
who the hell are these clowns ?
it even looks dangerous on a map .
it 's not like her .
but i 'm still doing it , because this is a higher duty !
mr. miller ?
he 's got nothing to bla@@ b about .
what 's wrong , maggie ?
i 'm not leaning .
i don 't know .
why ?
i don 't know !
you look back at the body .
how come when i was in a coma , you never came in to look in on me before i croa@@ ked ?
because we still need your help .
seems to me to be a case of " she doth protest too much . "
i 'm trying to make it right .
what ?
- so why are you so worried ?
who the hell is that ?
it is okay .
mm , you conduct daily scans for spy@@ ware you know how to look for .
you sound pretty confident about that .
everything .
you seem to have a bee in your bonnet about the captain .
none of them saw any suspicious activity .
no one can see anything .
but th - that doesn 't make sense .
and then he makes you take that stupid job to support the family while he starts his new business .
bill , where are those giant vaults ?
we may be able to pull some prints off of it .
on it .
remember the figu@@ ero@@ a street slaughter ?
if that means a discharge , i 'll take it .
